üåø Cotton Crop Management using TLA+

This repository contains a formal verification model for cotton crop health management, designed using TLA+ and PlusCal. The module implements an automated decision-making system that evaluates disease symptoms, growth stages, and pest risks based on provided inputs. The PlusCal algorithm helps in systematically identifying the most likely disease, optimal growth stage, and critical pest threat, ensuring data-driven agricultural decision-making.

üìå Features

Disease Diagnosis: Matches observed symptoms with known diseases.
Growth Stage Evaluation: Identifies the best growth stage for cotton crops.
Pest Risk Assessment: Determines the most critical pest based on growth conditions.
TLA+ Formal Verification: Ensures correctness in disease prediction and crop phase transitions.

Install TLA+ Toolbox
Download from: TLA+ GitHub
Run Model Checking
Open cottoncropoverall.tla in TLA+ Toolbox and execute the model checker.

üî¨ TLA+ Verification
Ensures logical consistency in disease, growth stage, and pest assessments.
Verifies requirement properties, such as:
Symptom-based disease classification.
Growth stage matching for optimal yield.
Pest impact assessment for crop protection.

üèÜ Future Enhancements
Extend to real-time data inputs.
Integrate climate and soil condition factors.
Apply machine learning for dynamic rule optimization.


Conclusions

The conclusion will be refined to summarize the key findings of our study, emphasizing the accuracy and applicability of the CNN model for cotton disease prediction. Additionally, we will highlight the potential impact of AI-driven monitoring on sustainable cotton farming practices and future improvements.

Limitations

The limitations of our study, including the dependency on high-quality labeled datasets, sensitivity to image variations (lighting, angle, resolution), and the exclusion of external environmental factors such as soil health and weather conditions. Future research directions will also be suggested to enhance the robustness of the approach.
